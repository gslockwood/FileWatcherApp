  "OK": "A safe landing with only minor deviations. Considered a good pass.",
  "_OK_": "An OK pass achieved under unfavorable circumstances.",
  "Fair": "A safe landing with one or more noticeable deviations or corrections.",
  "Bolter": "A safe pass where the aircraft does not catch a wire and goes around for another attempt.",
  "No Grade": "A safe pass but with gross deviations or corrections, or a failure to respond to LSO calls.",
  "Waveoff (WO)": "An instruction from the LSO for the pilot to abort the landing and go around, usually due to an unsafe approach or a foul deck.",
  "Cut": "An unsafe pass with unacceptable deviations, mandating an immediate waveoff if not already a bolter.",
  "Hook Skip (HS)": "The tailhook bounced over the arresting wires.",
  "Foul Deck (FD)": "The landing area was not clear for landing (e.g., another aircraft or debris). Usually results in a waveoff.",
  "No Ball (NB)": "Pilot did not call the \"ball\" (glide slope indicator) in sight at the appropriate time.",
  "Clara": "Pilot reports not having visual contact with the ball.",
  "Wire(s)": "Indicates which arresting wire was caught (e.g., \"Wire 1,\" \"Wire 2,\" \"Wire 3\"). A \"3-wire\" catch is generally considered ideal.",
  "EGIW (Eased Guns In Wires)": "Pilot reduced power while still in the wires, which is dangerous. Often results in a \"No Grade\" or worse.",
  "AW (After Wires)": "Something happened after the aircraft engaged the wires.",
  "3 PTS (Three Point Strike)": "Aircraft landed with all three landing gear touching down simultaneously, which can be hard on the nose gear.",
  "TMRDIC (Too Much Rate of Descent In Close)": "Excessive sink rate very near touchdown.",
  "SLOX (Slow At the Start)": "Aircraft was slow at the beginning of the approach.",
  "LOIM (Low In the Middle)": "Aircraft was below the glide path in the middle of the approach.",
  "LOIC (Low In Close)": "Aircraft was below the glide path near touchdown.",
  "LURX (Lined Up Right At the Start)": "Aircraft was misaligned to the right at the beginning.",
  "DRX (Drifted Right At the Start)": "Aircraft was drifting to the right early in the approach.",
  "FX (Fast At the Start)": "Aircraft was too fast at the beginning.",
  "LURIM (Lined Up Right In the Middle)": "Aircraft was misaligned to the right in the middle.",
  "DLIC (Drifted Left In Close)": "Aircraft was drifting to the left near touchdown.",
  "LULIM (Lined Up Left In Middle)": "Aircraft was misaligned to the left in the middle.",
  "LURIC (Lined Up Right In Close)": "Aircraft was misaligned to the right near touchdown.",
  "WO(AFU)IC (Wave Off (All Fouled Up) In Close)": "A waveoff due to a significant issue very near the carrier.",
  "LRTL (Landed Right To Land)": "Aircraft touched down significantly to the right of the centerline.",
  "EGTL": "Engaged Ground Tie-Down Linkage (unsafe condition).",
  "LOAR": "Low on Approach Ramp.",
  "LNFIW": "Landed Nose First In Wires.",
  "TMRDIC": "Too Much Rate of Descent In Close.",
  "AFU": "All Fouled Up.",
  "IC": "In Close (used to modify other grades, indicating a problem near touchdown).",
  "LULX": "Lined Up Left At the Start.",
  "PTSIW": "Propeller Tip Strike In Wires (for propeller aircraft).",
  "WX": "Wingtip Strike.",
  "DRIM": "Drifted Right In the Middle.",
